# Q_Theory
Intangible Capital and the Stability of the Investment–q Relation in U.S. Tech Firms Since 1995. Does replacing standard Tobin's q with a total-q measure that incorporates internally generated intangible capital restore a stable relation between physical investment and q for public U.S. tech firms from 1995 onward?

Background and Motivation
A large empirical literature documents a breakdown of the traditional investment-q relationship in the late twentieth century. Andrei, Mann, and Moyen (2018) revisit this so-called “q-theory failure” and argue that the breakdown is largely the result of measurement error rather than a failure of the theory itself. Using the standard Tobin’s Q, they
show that the investment-q regression fits poorly during 1975–1990, with an R² of only about 6.5%. However, oncethey correct the measurement of q and incorporate intangible capital in constructing Total q, the fit improves dramatically in the modern period (1995–2015), rising to over 70 percent.
The key idea in their paper is that the growing volatility and dispersion of Tobin’s q in the modern economy is not just noise, but actually contains useful information about firms’ investment opportunities, as long as intangible capital is properly accounted for. In other words, q becomes more volatile, but also more informative, once the economy becomes more R&D-intensive. They argue that this informative volatility comes from two main sources. First, innovation creates jump risk in firm value. R&D spending raises the chance of breakthroughs in productivity and profitability, which makes future cash flows more uncertain and more volatile. This increased uncertainty then shows up in market valuations and in Tobin’s Q. Second, R&D-intensive firms are constantly learning. Through experimentation, patents, and market feedback, firms continuously update their beliefs about future growth, which leads to frequent and sometimes sharp revisions in their valuations. As a result, q moves around more — and those movements reflect real information
about prospects.
As Andrei, Mann, and Moyen (2018) put it, “the firm’s increased cash flow volatility from innovations directly feeds into the volatility of Tobin’s q valuations, generating a better fit in the investment-q regression.” Once intangible capital is included and measurement error is addressed, they conclude that:
● (i) Q-theory works well in the modern economy;
● (ii) Investment responds strongly and consistently to marginal q; and
● (iii) The theory is especially relevant in high-tech and R&D-intensive sectors.

Research Gaps & Motivation

The questions remain unanswered by the authors:
• They do not restrict attention to public U.S. tech firms only.
• They do not focus on post-1995 as a structural break.
• They do not study the subperiod stability over time of the physical investment–q relation.
• They do not break heterogeneity among R&D-intensive tech firms.
• They do not frame the question as “restoring stability.”

In light of this project, which is clearly derivative in measurement, i will respond to the pressing questions that remain untouched.
